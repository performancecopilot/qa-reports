NAME
 pminfo - display information about performance metrics

SYNOPSIS
 pminfo [-dfFIlLmMstTvVxz?] [-a archive] [-b batchsize] [-c dmfile]
 [--container name] [-D debug] [-h hostname] [-K spec] [-[n|N] pmnsfile]
 [-O time] [-r dmname=expr] [-Z timezone] [metricname | pmid | indom]...

DESCRIPTION
 pminfo displays various types of information about performance metrics
 available through the facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).

 The metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments. If met-
 ricname is a non-leaf node in the PMNS, then pminfo will recursively
 descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes. If no metricname argu-
 ment is given, the root of the PMNS is used.

 If the metricname argument is in numeric dotted notation, it is inter-
 preted as either a 3-dotted pmid (metric identifier - domain, cluster,
 item numbers) or a 2-dotted indom (instance domain identifier - domain,
 serial number). In the pmid case, a reverse PMID-to-name lookup is
 performed, and in the indom case, the instance domain is reported di-
 rectly. This latter mode can be used to report the instance domain
 ``one line'' and long form help text summaries.

 Unless directed to another host by the -h option, by default pminfo
 will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the lo-
 cal host. The connection to a PMCD is only required if pminfo requires
 distributed PMNS information, and/or meta-data describing metrics,
 and/or metric values, and/or help text.

 The -a option causes pminfo to use the specified set of archives rather
 than connecting to a PMCD.

 The -L option causes pminfo to use a local context to collect metrics
 from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD. Only some metrics are
 available in this mode.

 The -a, -h and -L options are mutually exclusive.

OPTIONS
 The available command line options are:

 -a archive, --archive=archive
 Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of Perfor-
 mance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive files identified by the archive argu-
 ment, which is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may
 be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory contain-
 ing one or more archives.

 -b, --batch
 This option may be used to define the maximum number of metrics to
 be fetched in a single request for the -f and -v options. The de-
 fault value for batchsize is 128.

 -c dmfile, --derived=dmfile
 The dmfile argument specifies a file that contains derived metric
 definitions in the format described for pmLoadDerivedConfig(3).
 The -c option provides a way to load global derived metric defini-
 tions that is an alternative to the more generic use of the
 PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment variable as described in PCPIn-
 tro(1). Using the -c option and the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environ-
 ment variable to specify the same configuration is a bad idea, so
 choose one or the other method. See also the -r option below.

 --container=container
 Specify an individual container to be queried.

 -d, --desc
 Metric descriptions detailing the PMID, data type, data semantics,
 units, scale and associated instance domain.

 -f, --fetch
 Fetch and print values for all instances. When fetching from a
 set of archives, only those instances present in the first archive
 record for a metric will be displayed; see also the -O option,
 else use pmlogdump(1) which may be a better tool for examining
 archives.

 -F, --fetchall
 Same as -f but try harder to fetch instances for metrics which
 have non-enumerable instance domains (e.g. metrics in the ``proc''
 subtree of the default PMNS on some platforms).

 -h host, --host=host
 Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than from
 the default localhost.

 -I, --fullindom
 Print the InDom in verbose mode.

 -K spec, --spec-local=spec
 When using the -L option to fetch metrics from a local context,
 this option controls the DSO PMDAs that should be made accessible.
 The spec argument conforms to the syntax described in pmSpecLo-
 calPMDA(3). More than one -K option may be used.

 -l, --labels
 Print label sets associated with metrics and instances. Labels
 are optional metric metadata described in detail in pmLookupLa-
 bels(3).

 -L, --local-PMDA
 Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the local
 host without PMCD. See also -K.

 -m, --pmid
 Print the PMID in terse mode.

 -M, --fullpmid
 Print the PMID in verbose mode.

 -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
 Normally pminfo operates on the distributed Performance Metrics
 Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is specified an alter-
 native local PMNS is loaded from the file pmnsfile.

 -N pmnsfile, --uniqnames=pmnsfile
 The -N option supports the same function as -n, except for the
 handling of duplicate names for the same Performance Metric Iden-
 tifier (PMID) in pmnsfile - duplicate names are allowed with -n
 but they are not allowed with -N.

 -O time, --origin=time
 When used in conjunction with an archive source of metrics and the
 options -f/, the time argument defines a time origin at which the
 metrics should be fetched from the set of archives. Refer to
 PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of this option, and the
 syntax for the time argument.

 -r dmname=expr, --register=dmname=expr
 Register a per-context derived metric using pmAddDerivedMetric(3).
 dmname is the name of the new derived metric, and expr is the ex-
 pression for the derived metric, following the syntax described in
 pmRegisterDerived(3). Multiple -r options are allowed. See also
 the -c option above.

 -s, --series
 Print time series identifiers associated with metrics, instances
 and sources. These unique identifiers are calculated from intrin-
 sic (non-optional) labels and other metric metadata associated
 with each PMAPI context (sources), metrics and instances.
 Archive, local context or pmcd(1) connections for the same host
 all produce the same source identifier. See also pmLookupLa-
 bels(3) and the -l option.

 -t, --oneline
 Print the ``one line'' help summary, if available.

 -T, --helptext
 Print the help text, if available.

 -v, --verify
 Verify mode in which descriptions and values are retrieved, but
 only error conditions are reported. This option silently disables
 any output from the options -f/--fetch, -l/--labels,
 -I/--fullindom, -M/--fullpmid, -m/--pmid, -t/--oneline and
 -T/--helptext.

 -V, --version
 Display version number and exit.

 -x, --events
 Like the -f/--fetch option, but with the additional functionality
 that if a value is processed that is of type PM_TYPE_EVENT or
 PM_TYPE_HIGHRES_EVENT, then the event records will be unpacked and
 the details of each event record reported.

 -z, --hostzone
 Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the host
 that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via
 either the -h or -a options.

 -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
 By default, pminfo reports the time of day according to the local
 timezone on the system where pminfo is run. The -Z option changes
 the timezone to timezone in the format of the environment variable
 TZ as described in environ(7).

 -?, --help
 Display usage message and exit.

FILES
 $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*
 default local PMNS specification files

PCP ENVIRONMENT
 Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
 file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file
 /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values for these variables. The
 $PCP_CONF variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
 file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

 For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see pmGetOptions(3).

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
 The -D or --debug option enables the output of additional diagnostics
 on stderr to help triage problems, although the information is some-
 times cryptic and primarily intended to provide guidance for developers
 rather end-users. debug is a comma separated list of debugging op-
 tions; use pmdbg(1) with the -l option to obtain a list of the avail-
 able debugging options and their meaning.

 Debugging options specific to pminfo are as follows:
 +--------+------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Option | Description |
 +--------+------------------------------------------------------------+
 | appl4 | report batch downsizing if batchsize would exceed maximum |
 | | PDU size |
 +--------+------------------------------------------------------------+
 | appl5 | dump PDU stats at end if context is a host |
 +--------+------------------------------------------------------------+
