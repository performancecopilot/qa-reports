Test pmcd timeouts with the pmcd PMDA's pmcd.control.timeout


*** pmcd agent timeout < app timeout ***
*** pmcd will killoff agent ***

app timeout = 10
pmcd timeout = 5
pmcd.control.timeout old value=5 new value=5

Expect dummyproc to fail (IPC protocol failure):
dummyproc: pmLookupDesc: IPC protocol failure

pmcd terminated dummy the dumb_pmda agent as desired

*** pmcd agent timeout > app timeout ***
*** pmcd will not killoff agent until later ***

app timeout = 5
pmcd timeout = 10
pmcd.control.timeout old value=5 new value=10

Expect dummyproc to fail (timeout for pmcd failure):

pmcd did NOT terminate the dumb_pmda agent as desired

Now wait for pmcd to timeout...

pmcd terminated the dumb_pmda agent as desired
